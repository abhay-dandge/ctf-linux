# Level 5 - The Final Boss 🔥  

Congratulations on making it this far! 🎉  
But beware — this is the **final level** and the most dangerous one. One wrong step and you could lose everything.  

---

## 🎯 Objective  
You now have **root access**. But guess what?  
Root is useless this time. 😈  

There’s a **mysterious file** hidden deep inside the system. It’s not readable in its current form — it’s **encoded**.  
Your task is to **decode** it and reveal the hidden message.  

---

## 🕵️ What You Need To Do  
1. Start by searching for suspicious files. (Root access might tempt you, but don’t go blindly using it everywhere 🚫).  
2. Once you find the file, carefully analyze it.  
3. It looks encoded — figure out **which encoding/obfuscation** method was used.  
4. Decode it step by step.  
5. The decoded message is your **flag** 🎌.  

---

## ⚠️ Warnings  
- One wrong step could **destroy the file** or make it unreadable forever.  
- Don’t rush — take backups before trying anything.  
- Think like a hacker: sometimes **simple is deadly**.  

---

## 💡 Hint  
> "Sometimes what looks dangerous is just a puzzle in disguise.  
> The key lies not in *root power*, but in your ability to recognize patterns."  

---

## ✅ Goal  
Reveal the secret message hidden inside the encoded file.  

---

Good luck, challenger. This is the **Boss Level** — only the smartest survive. 🧩
